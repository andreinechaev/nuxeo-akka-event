## Nuxeo Akka Event

The package is an experimental work for replacing/extending Nuxeo Event Service with Akka

#### Motivation

Akka as an event system allows to create truly distributed and fault-tolerant solutions. Instead of using common services
as connection points for each node, a flexible event-based system can help to achieve the same goal with less effort (potentially :))
